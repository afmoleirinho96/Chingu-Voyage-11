This Project has the main purpouse to make use of the MapBox API to create a map and follow along the Portuguese Cities that are shown in the image above.
It also has the functionality of permuting the behaviour of the map, as well as moving arround the map of the world or even locating yourself in the map.

# Chingu Voyage 11
It is also a pre work for the 11th Voyage of Chingu, a platform that allows you to produce code and be part of a team, with Agile methodologies,
following along a plan of 6 weeks.
The difficulty of the Chingu Project will depend on your Tier. Read more about it in this link : https://chingu.gitbook.io/chingu-voyage-handbook/

The main challenge was indeed to understand the MapBox API and throughout the duration of this project 
I learned not only some core concepts of this API and it's functionalities, but also how to implement a Service Worker, caching files.

To get to know more about MapBox API: https://www.mapbox.com
I completed this Project with minimum dependencies, with vanilla Javascript & HTML & CSS so feel free to fork or clone the Project and all you have to do is to run the index.html in your workspace.

A proper link to the deployed solution will be attached here soon...
